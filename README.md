It's me, Adam!

# Usage

## npm

```
npx adambowles
```

<!-- ## GitHub Package Registry
Assuming you have the GitHub registry set up, you can use via npx:
```
npx @adambowles/card
``` -->

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
